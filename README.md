<h2>A simple CMS based in Django</h2>

Me and a friend needed a simple cms for posting zines, we actually wanted to look old-fashion with ascii art and all that 90's stuff. It has an admin panel where you can add posts, info in the tools page and change the about page.
This project is kind of old (~4 months old aprox.) but I still wanted to share it.

<h3> Disclaimer </h3>
This was written a long ago, and the code is probably not the best. I also want to add that this is my first django project so has a lot of crap from trying things and tinkering around.
It has some security flaws and some things could have been done better but I'm happy overall.

Peace!
